# ArduinoTicTacToe
This is a group me and a friend did for a project in university.

We used an Arduino along with the following products:

DFRobot LCD: https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1737.html
DFRobot RGB Buttons: https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2634.html

We also used an OLED screen but you can use any OLED with an SSD1306 controller.
