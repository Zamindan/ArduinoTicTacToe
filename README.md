# ArduinoTicTacToe
This is a group me and a friend did for a project in university. It's a project that consists of using 3 buttons to play Tic Tac Toe. You have 2 buttons for left and right and a middle one to select where you want to place an X or an O.


We used an Arduino along with the following products:

DFRobot LCD: https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1737.html

DFRobot RGB Buttons: https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2634.html

We also used an OLED screen but you can use any OLED with an SSD1306 controller.
